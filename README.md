# Predictive-Analysis-of-Heart-Disease-Risk-Factors-A-Data-Mining-Approach
This project focuses on the exploration and prediction of heart disease risk factors using data sourced from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The primary purpose is to analyze various health indicators and develop predictive models that assess an individual's risk of heart disease.
Project Overview
Files Included:
ALY 6040_Finalproject.docx: A comprehensive report detailing the project methodology, analysis, and findings.
Heart disease_No nans-Final-Co (3).ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis, including exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling.
Purpose
The goal of this project is to utilize machine learning techniques to identify and predict potential heart disease risk factors based on health-related variables. By analyzing a dataset comprising demographic information, health behaviors, and medical history, the project aims to provide insights that can enhance early detection and prevention strategies for heart disease.
How to Use the Files
